# Business Context

## Product
[Describe what you build]

Example: "A collaboration tool for remote teams that combines project management, async communication, and document collaboration in one place."

## Target User
[Who uses your product]

Example:
- Role: Product designers, developers, PMs in remote-first startups
- Company size: 10-100 people
- Pain: Switching between 5+ tools (Slack, Notion, Figma, Jira, etc.)

## Problem We Solve
[Why they need you]

Example: "Remote teams lose context when information is scattered across multiple tools. We centralize everything so teams can work async without losing clarity."

## Competitive Context
[Alternatives they consider]

Example:
- Notion (for docs, light project management)
- Linear (for project management, engineering-focused)
- Slack + plugins (communication-first approach)
- Our differentiation: Built for async-first, all-in-one

## Current State
[Where you are today]

Example:
- Stage: Series A, 50 customers, 2,000 active users
- Team: 15 people (5 eng, 3 design, 2 PM, 5 ops/sales)
- Recent launches: Timeline view, AI summaries, mobile app
- Next 90 days: Focus on activation (onboarding → active usage)
