# Business Outcome

## Current Outcome
[Specific metric you're optimizing]

Example: "Increase activation rate from 42% to 55% in Q1 2026"

**NOT an outcome:**
- "Improve the product"
- "Make users happier"
- "Build more features"

**IS an outcome:**
- "Increase weekly active users by 30% in 90 days"
- "Reduce time to first value from 7 days to 3 days"
- "Increase feature adoption of [X] from 20% to 40%"

## Why This Matters
[Business impact]

Example: "Activation predicts long-term retention. Users who activate in first week have 3x higher 6-month retention. If we increase activation from 42% to 55%, we project +$500K ARR in 12 months."

## How We Measure
[Specific metric definition]

Example:
- **Activated user:** Completed 3+ core actions in first 7 days
- **Core actions:** Created project, invited teammate, published document
- **Measurement:** Track cohorts weekly, measure activation within first 7 days
- **Current baseline:** 42% (measured across last 8 weeks)

## Timeframe
[When you need to achieve this]

Example: "Q1 2026 (end date: March 31, 2026)"

**Why Claude Needs This:**

When Claude analyzes transcripts, it will prioritize opportunities that connect to this outcome.

Example:
- Transcript mentions: "I get lost when I come back after 2 days"
- Claude thinks: "This impacts frequency of usage → impacts activation (need multiple sessions in first 7 days) → HIGH PRIORITY"
- vs: "Users want dark mode" → doesn't connect to activation → noted but not prioritized

**Instructions:**
1. Define ONE outcome per quarter
2. Make it measurable (specific metric + number + timeframe)
3. Explain why it matters (business impact)
4. Define how you measure it precisely
5. Update when you change strategic focus (typically quarterly)
